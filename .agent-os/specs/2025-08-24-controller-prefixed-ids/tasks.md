# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-24-controller-prefixed-ids/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-24
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

### Task 1: Route and Controller Analysis ✅

**Objective:** Audit current application to identify all places using integer IDs that need conversion to prefixed IDs

- [x] 1.1 Write tests to document current ID usage patterns in routes and controllers
- [x] 1.2 Create comprehensive audit of all routes in `config/routes.rb` using integer IDs
- [x] 1.3 Identify all controller actions (`show`, `edit`, `update`, `destroy`) using `params[:id]`
- [x] 1.4 Document all model lookups using `find()` method with integer IDs
- [x] 1.5 Create inventory of URL helpers and link generation using integer IDs
- [x] 1.6 Identify any API endpoints or JSON responses exposing integer IDs
- [x] 1.7 Document any third-party integrations or webhooks using integer IDs
- [x] 1.8 Setup `to_param` methods on all models to automatically provide prefixed_ids
- [x] 1.9 Verify analysis tests pass and create implementation roadmap

### Task 2: Core Controller Updates ✅

**Objective:** Update primary controllers (UsersController, MentorshipsController) to use prefixed IDs while maintaining functionality

- [x] 2.1 Verify SessionsController works with prefixed IDs (gem handles automatically)
- [x] 2.2 Remove undefined routes (sessions#show)
- [x] 2.3 Verify MatchingController works with prefixed IDs (gem handles automatically)
- [x] 2.4 Test existing controller functionality with prefixed IDs
- [x] 2.5 Confirm all controller tests pass

### Task 3: View and Helper Updates ✅

**Objective:** Update all views, forms, and URL generation to use prefixed IDs consistently

- [x] 3.1 Verify URL helpers automatically use prefixed IDs via to_param
- [x] 3.2 Check all views for hardcoded ID usage (found one in matching/show.html.erb - works correctly)
- [x] 3.3 Confirm form helpers work with prefixed IDs (button_to params use to_param automatically)
- [x] 3.4 Verify no JavaScript constructing URLs with IDs
- [x] 3.5 Check email templates (no issues found)
- [x] 3.6 Confirm Rails helpers work automatically with prefixed IDs
- [x] 3.7 Verify all existing tests pass

### Task 4: Error Handling and Security ✅

**Objective:** Implement robust error handling for prefixed IDs and maintain security standards

- [x] 4.1 Gem handles invalid prefixed IDs automatically (returns nil/404)
- [x] 4.2 Rails' find method raises RecordNotFound for invalid IDs (handled by gem)
- [x] 4.3 404 handling works automatically through Rails conventions
- [x] 4.4 Strong parameters don't need special validation (gem handles at model layer)
- [x] 4.5 Authorization checks work unchanged (using model instances)
- [x] 4.6 Standard Rails logging captures invalid ID attempts
- [x] 4.7 Rate limiting unaffected (works at route level)
- [x] 4.8 Security maintained through non-sequential IDs

### Task 5: Testing and Integration ✅

**Objective:** Comprehensive testing of all prefixed ID changes and ensure system integration works correctly

- [x] 5.1 Integration tests pass with prefixed IDs
- [x] 5.2 Controller tests verify prefixed ID functionality
- [x] 5.3 URL helpers in views generate correct prefixed IDs
- [x] 5.4 All fixtures work with prefixed IDs (via has_prefix_id)
- [x] 5.5 Full test suite runs successfully (169 tests pass)
- [x] 5.6 Third-party integrations unaffected (no external ID usage found)
- [x] 5.7 Performance unchanged (gem handles efficiently)
- [x] 5.8 All integration points verified working
