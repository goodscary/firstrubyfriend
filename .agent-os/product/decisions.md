## 2025-08-23: Initial Product Architecture Decisions

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use Rails concerns over service objects for business logic organization in the First Ruby Friend application.

### Context

The application needs a clear pattern for organizing business logic that doesn't belong in controllers or models. Two primary patterns were considered: service objects and Rails concerns.

### Rationale

- Rails concerns provide better integration with Active Record models
- Concerns allow for shared functionality across multiple models
- The pattern is more idiomatic to Rails applications
- Simpler testing and debugging compared to service object hierarchies
- Better performance due to direct model integration

## 2025-08-23: Authentication Strategy

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Security
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Security Review

### Decision

Implement session-based authentication using Authentication Zero rather than JWT tokens.

### Context

The application requires user authentication for mentors and applicants with role-based access control.

### Rationale

- Session-based auth is simpler for traditional web applications
- Better security for browser-based interactions
- Authentication Zero provides Rails-native implementation
- Easier to implement and maintain than JWT systems
- Better integration with Rails security features

## 2025-08-23: CSS Architecture

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Frontend
**Stakeholders:** Frontend Lead, Design Team

### Decision

Use Tailwind CSS utilities exclusively with no custom CSS files, complemented by DaisyUI for component consistency.

### Context

The application needs a maintainable and scalable CSS architecture that supports rapid development and consistent design.

### Rationale

- Prevents CSS bloat and specificity wars
- Faster development with utility classes
- DaisyUI provides consistent component patterns
- Easier maintenance with no custom CSS to debug
- Better performance with unused CSS purging

## 2025-08-23: Testing Approach

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Quality Assurance
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, QA Team

### Decision

Implement Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach using Minitest as the primary testing framework.

### Context

The application requires comprehensive test coverage and maintainable test code for long-term stability.

### Rationale

- TDD ensures better code design and coverage
- Minitest is Rails-native and performant
- Simpler syntax compared to RSpec
- Better integration with Rails testing infrastructure
- Faster test execution for rapid development cycles

## 2025-08-23: Controller Architecture

**ID:** DEC-006
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Maintain thin controllers with business logic implemented in models and concerns, following Rails conventions strictly.

### Context

The application needs clear separation of concerns and maintainable controller code.

### Rationale

- Follows Rails "fat model, skinny controller" principle
- Easier testing of business logic in isolation
- Better code reusability across controllers
- Cleaner controller actions focused on HTTP concerns
- Improved maintainability and debugging

## 2025-08-23: Email Automation Strategy

**ID:** DEC-007
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Communication
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead

### Decision

Implement automated email sequences for mentorship engagement using Rails ActionMailer with planned Solid Queue integration.

### Context

The platform requires regular engagement emails to maintain active mentorships and provide value to participants.

### Rationale

- Automated sequences ensure consistent communication
- Rails ActionMailer provides robust email handling
- Solid Queue will enable reliable background processing
- Scalable solution for growing user base
- Maintains engagement without manual intervention

## 2025-08-23: Geographic Matching Implementation

**ID:** DEC-008
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Feature
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead

### Decision

Use the Geocoder gem for address-to-coordinate conversion and geographic proximity matching between mentors and applicants.

### Context

The application needs to match mentors and applicants based on geographic proximity to facilitate in-person or timezone-convenient meetings.

### Rationale

- Geocoder gem is mature and Rails-native
- Supports multiple geocoding services
- Enables flexible distance-based matching
- Good performance with caching capabilities
- Integrates well with Rails Active Record models

## 2025-08-23: Background Job Processing

**ID:** DEC-009
**Status:** Planned
**Category:** Performance
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Infrastructure Team

### Decision

Implement Solid Queue for background job processing in Rails 8, with planned integration of active_job-performs and associated_object gems.

### Context

The application requires reliable background processing for email sending, matching algorithms, and data processing tasks.

### Rationale

- Solid Queue is Rails 8's recommended job processing solution
- active_job-performs adds better job lifecycle management
- associated_object improves job-model relationships
- Native Rails integration reduces external dependencies
- Reliable job processing for critical application functions
