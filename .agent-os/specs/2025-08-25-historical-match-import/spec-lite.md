# Historical Match Import - Lite Summary

Import historical mentorship data from CSV files (mentors, applicants, matches) from the previous First Ruby Friend platform, creating user accounts, establishing mentorship relationships with proper reassignment handling, and backfilling email sent dates based on match creation dates for approximately 2,000 records from 2023-present.

## Key Points
- Import 3 CSV file types: mentors (13 fields), applicants (15 fields), and monthly matches (4 fields)
- Create User accounts without passwords for all historical mentors and applicants
- Establish Mentorship relationships based on match data with proper reassignment handling (voiding previous matches when new ones are created)
