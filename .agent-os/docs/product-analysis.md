## Technical Debt Identified

### High Priority
1. **Test Coverage Configuration**
   - SimpleCov reporting 0% incorrectly
   - Need to fix coverage reporting
   - Add missing critical tests

2. **Database Migration Needed**
   - SQLite not suitable for production
   - Plan PostgreSQL migration
   - Add missing indexes

3. **Email Delivery Tracking**
   - 12 timestamp columns in mentorships table
   - Should use separate email_deliveries table
   - Better tracking and analytics

### Medium Priority
1. **API Development**
   - No API endpoints currently
   - Needed for mobile/third-party integration
   - Consider GraphQL or JSON API

2. **Background Jobs**
   - No job processing system
   - Needed for email delivery
   - Consider Sidekiq or GoodJob

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - No caching implementation
   - Redis available but underutilized
   - Fragment caching opportunities

### Low Priority
1. **Frontend Modernization**
   - Limited JavaScript usage
   - Could enhance UX with more Stimulus
   - Consider ViewComponents

2. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Basic logging only
   - No APM integration
   - Limited error tracking

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance
- Simple queries, minimal N+1 risk
- No heavy computations identified
- Geographic queries may need optimization

### Optimization Opportunities
1. Add database indexes for foreign keys
2. Implement query result caching
3. Use counter caches for associations
4. Optimize geographic matching queries

## Security Assessment

### Strengths
- Strong password requirements
- Session security with tracking
- CSRF protection enabled
- Rate limiting in production
- SQL injection protection via ActiveRecord

### Recommendations
1. Add 2FA support
2. Implement account lockout
3. Add security headers middleware
4. Regular dependency updates
5. Security audit logging

## Feature Completeness

### Implemented Features
- User registration/authentication
- Profile management
- Questionnaires
- Basic matching
- Email notifications
- Admin features (masquerade)

### Missing Core Features
1. **Matching Algorithm**
   - Currently basic implementation
   - No scoring or ranking
   - No preference weighting

2. **Communication Tools**
   - No in-app messaging
   - No video call integration
   - Limited notification options

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - No goal setting
   - No milestone tracking
   - No feedback system

4. **Analytics**
   - No admin dashboard
   - No success metrics
   - No reporting tools

## Scalability Analysis

### Current Limitations
- SQLite database
- No background job processing
- Limited caching
- Single server architecture

### Scaling Path
1. **Phase 1**: PostgreSQL migration
2. **Phase 2**: Add background jobs
3. **Phase 3**: Implement caching
4. **Phase 4**: Add CDN for assets
