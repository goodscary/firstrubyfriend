# HTML Style Guide

## Structure Rules
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Place nested elements on new lines with proper indentation
- Content between tags should be on its own line when multi-line
- Run the HERB formatter to format HTML on save

## Attribute Formatting
- Place each HTML attribute on its own line
- Align attributes vertically
- Keep the closing `>` on the same line as the last attribute
