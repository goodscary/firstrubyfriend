## UI component best practices

- **Helpers & Partials over components**: Use the default framework partials and helpers for repeatable UI components.
- **Don't reinvent the wheel**: Use the framework examples and manage within existing design assets.
- **Composability**: Build complex UIs by combining smaller, simpler components rather than monolithic structures
