Hey there,
Time to book your final proscribed meeting with your mentor, if you haven't already. Their email is <%= @mentor.email %> in case you don't have it handy.
Time to move on?
I really hope you've found this programme, such as it is, to be useful for you.
I mentioned last month to think about "what now" in terms of this mentorship relationship. Perhaps it just falls back to "someone you can call on" at a later date in case you need to. Maybe you'll continue to stay in touch. Maybe you'll meet each other at an in person event.
Whatever it is, I hope you've found a new, helpful #rubyfriend.
I'll be back in touch in a few months when hopefullly you'll consider sharing your experience with someone new in our community.


Let me know if there are things you'd like to see this programme do for other folks in the future.
Or if there's been a particular resource that's been "career changing" that your mentor has suggested. Or even that you've discovered yourself.
Just hit reply!


Andy
