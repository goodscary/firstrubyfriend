# README

## Setup

If you'd like to contribute to this project, follow the steps below to set it up:

1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/goodscary/firstrubyfriend/fork)
2. Clone the forked repo onto your machine, then `cd` into the project directory
3. Run `bin /setup` to install dependencies and prepare the database
4. Start the server with `rails s` or `bin/dev`

<!-- 5. Write tests -->
<!-- 6. [Sync your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) to keep it up to date with the upstream repository -->
<!-- 7. Push your changes up and open a PR, filling out any relevant details in the PR template -->
<!-- Tag @andycroll for a review -->

### Tests

You can run tests with `rails test`. To run all tests in a file, use `rails test filename.rb`. To run a single test, pass in a line number `rails test filename.rb:10`.

### Debugging

We use the [`debug` gem](https://github.com/ruby/debug) for debugging. Breakpoints don't work with `bin/dev`, so make sure to start the server with `rails s` if you want to use `binding.break`, `debugger` or `binding.b`.

## About this project

<!-- technical decisions, important details on system architecture -->
<!-- preferred style guides -->

### CSS

This app uses styles provided by [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) CSS. Whenever possible, try to avoid adding any custom styles.

### Authentication

This project uses the pre-built authentication system generated by [Authentication Zero](https://github.com/lazaronixon/authentication-zero). When implementing new auth-related functionality, check if the gem can provide this first.
