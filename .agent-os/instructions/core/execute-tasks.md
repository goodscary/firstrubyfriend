# Task Execution Rules

## Overview

Initiate execution of one or more tasks for a given spec.

<pre_flight_check>
  EXECUTE: @.agent-os/instructions/meta/pre-flight.md
</pre_flight_check>

<process_flow>

<step number="1" name="task_assignment">

### Step 1: Task Assignment

Identify which tasks to execute from the spec (using spec_srd_reference file path and optional specific_tasks array), defaulting to the next uncompleted parent task if not specified.

<task_selection>
  <explicit>user specifies exact task(s)</explicit>
  <implicit>find next uncompleted task in tasks.md</implicit>
</task_selection>

<instructions>
  ACTION: Identify task(s) to execute
  DEFAULT: Select next uncompleted parent task if not specified
  CONFIRM: Task selection with user
</instructions>

</step>

<step number="2" subagent="context-fetcher" name="context_analysis">

### Step 2: Context Analysis

Use the context-fetcher subagent to gather minimal context for task understanding by always loading spec tasks.md, and conditionally loading @.agent-os/product/mission-lite.md, spec-lite.md, and sub-specs/technical-spec.md if not already in context.

<instructions>
  ACTION: Use context-fetcher subagent to:
    - REQUEST: "Get product pitch from mission-lite.md"
    - REQUEST: "Get spec summary from spec-lite.md"
    - REQUEST: "Get technical approach from technical-spec.md"
  PROCESS: Returned information
</instructions>


<context_gathering>
  <essential_docs>
    - tasks.md for task breakdown
  </essential_docs>
  <conditional_docs>
    - mission-lite.md for product alignment
    - spec-lite.md for feature summary
    - technical-spec.md for implementation details
  </conditional_docs>
</context_gathering>

</step>

<step number="3" name="development_server_check">

### Step 3: Check for Development Server

Check for any running development server and ask user permission to shut it down if found to prevent port conflicts.

<server_check_flow>
  <if_running>
    ASK user to shut down
    WAIT for response
  </if_running>
  <if_not_running>
    PROCEED immediately
  </if_not_running>
</server_check_flow>

<user_prompt>
  A development server is currently running.
  Should I shut it down before proceeding? (yes/no)
</user_prompt>

<instructions>
  ACTION: Check for running local development server
  CONDITIONAL: Ask permission only if server is running
  PROCEED: Immediately if no server detected
</instructions>

</step>

<step number="4" subagent="git-workflow" name="git_branch_management">

### Step 4: Git Branch Management

Use the git-workflow subagent to manage git branches to ensure proper isolation by creating or switching to the appropriate branch for the spec.

<instructions>
  ACTION: Use git-workflow subagent
  REQUEST: "Check and manage branch for spec: [SPEC_FOLDER]
            - Create branch if needed
            - Switch to correct branch
            - Handle any uncommitted changes"
  WAIT: For branch setup completion
</instructions>

<branch_naming>
  <source>spec folder name</source>
  <format>exclude date prefix</format>
  <example>
    - folder: 2025-03-15-password-reset
    - branch: password-reset
  </example>
</branch_naming>

</step>

<step number="5" name="task_execution_loop">

### Step 5: Task Execution Loop

Execute all assigned parent tasks and their subtasks using @.agent-os/instructions/core/execute-task.md instructions, continuing until all tasks are complete.

<execution_flow>
  LOAD @.agent-os/instructions/core/execute-task.md ONCE

  FOR each parent_task assigned in Step 1:
    EXECUTE instructions from execute-task.md with:
      - parent_task_number
      - all associated subtasks
    WAIT for task completion
    UPDATE tasks.md status
  END FOR
</execution_flow>

<loop_logic>
  <continue_conditions>
    - More unfinished parent tasks exist
    - User has not requested stop
  </continue_conditions>
  <exit_conditions>
    - All assigned tasks marked complete
    - User requests early termination
    - Blocking issue prevents continuation
  </exit_conditions>
</loop_logic>

<task_status_check>
  AFTER each task execution:
    CHECK tasks.md for remaining tasks
    IF all assigned tasks complete:
      PROCEED to next step
    ELSE:
      CONTINUE with next task
</task_status_check>

<instructions>
  ACTION: Load execute-task.md instructions once at start
  REUSE: Same instructions for each parent task iteration
  LOOP: Through all assigned parent tasks
  UPDATE: Task status after each completion
  VERIFY: All tasks complete before proceeding
  HANDLE: Blocking issues appropriately
</instructions>

</step>

<step number="6" name="complete_tasks">

### Step 6: Run the task completion steps

After all tasks in tasks.md have been implemented, use @.agent-os/instructions/core/complete-tasks.md to run our series of steps we always run when finishing and delivering a new feature.

<instructions>
  LOAD: @.agent-os/instructions/core/complete-tasks.md once
  ACTION: execute all steps in the complete-tasks.md process_flow.
</instructions>

</step>

</process_flow>

<post_flight_check>
  EXECUTE: @.agent-os/instructions/meta/post-flight.md
</post_flight_check>
