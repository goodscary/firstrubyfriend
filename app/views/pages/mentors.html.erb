      We're looking for mentors to contribute approximately three hours over a six-month
      period to guide early-career developers. Your experience level doesn't matter—both
      junior and seasoned engineers can contribute meaningfully.
    </p>

    <h2>Why mentor?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Junior developers make great mentors (recent relevant experience!)</li>
      <li>Teaching reinforces your own learning</li>
      <li>Give back to the community that helped you</li>
      <li>Meet new people in the Ruby world</li>
    </ul>

        <p>No! If you have more than a year of programming experience, you have something valuable to share. Junior devs often make excellent mentors because they remember what it's like to be new.</p>
