Hey there,
Time to book another meeting with your mentor, if you haven't already. Their email is <%= @mentor.email %> in case you don't have it handy.
Mentorship and your career
You only have a couple more meetings with your mentor. It's probably time to start thinking about what next.
Hopefully, you've found your sessions with your mentor enlightening and useful. Now is the time to consider what you want to do to grow your career in the coming months and years.
You could ask your existing mentor to carry on meeting on a semi-regular basis, or perhaps it might be good to get off the "treadmill" but ask to get in touch at a future particularly tricky career moment.
The question I want you to consider is "how can I continue to receive mentorship and support throughout my career?"
If you're in a job it's worth asking formally if you can be assigned a mentor, it'd be a good thing for more senior engineers in your organisation to have on their annual review!
But there's also other kinds of mentorship, some mentors might be more informal:
Someone you met at a conference or meet-upAn ex-boss now at a different companyPeers can be mentors in specific skills at which they excelSome mentors might just be people who's work and writing you follow on the internet or in books!


I would encourage you to think broadly about building a network of folks (as cheesy and awful as that sounds) of people you can email or go for coffee with when you need to discuss a problem with your career or current job.
When you can't reach out to your manager or immediate co-workers, it is important to have "work-ish" friends you can lean on for advice.
Don't be afraid to ask someone to help you, the Ruby community is full of helpful folks, the worst they can do is say "sorry no, I'm a bit busy", the best they can do is be an asset to your growth as an engineer.


Let me know what you think.
I'd love to hear about your thoughts on future mentorship.
Just hit reply! Speak soon.


Andy
