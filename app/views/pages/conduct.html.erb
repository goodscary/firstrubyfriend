      respectful, kind treatment of all participants and organizers.

      <strong>Matz Is Nice And So We Are Nice.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We emphasize kindness beyond just avoiding harassment. We discourage gatekeeping
      behaviors like unnecessary corrections and subtle discriminatory language that
      may alienate newcomers.
    </p>

    <h2>Harassment Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Zero tolerance for any harassing behavior, including offensive comments about
      identity, unwelcome advances, stalking, or disruptive conduct. Violators face
      immediate removal.
    </p>

    <h2>Making Mistakes</h2>
    <p>
      We recognize that accidental missteps differ from intentional harm. Members who
      say something hurtful should apologize promptly and educate themselves. Single
      incidents receive mediation; repeated or deliberate violations result in removal.
    </p>

    <h2>Reporting</h2>
    <p>
      Report violations to organizer Andy Croll at
      <a href="mailto:andy@goodscary.com">andy@goodscary.com</a>.
      Swift enforcement follows, from mediation to expulsion depending on severity.
    </p>

    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
      We commit to accommodating all participants' accessibility needs.
      Requests should go to the same contact email.
