<p>Hi there</p>

<p>Month three! Already! Your mentee should shortly be in touch to sort out their mentorship session.</p>

<p>Their email is:</p>

<p><b><%= link_to @applicant&.email || "nope", "mailto:#{@applicant&.email}" %></b></p> 

<p>Give them a chase if they're not in touch this week. If you've completely failed to connect by this point, please let me know and we'll get it sorted out. Sometimes itâ€™s life, sometimes it is overly enthusiastic spam filters.</p>

<h2>Mistakes were made and probably by you?</h2>

<p>A thing to think about this month.</p>

<p>We can agree or disagree about the specific definitions of "Imposter Syndrome" but there's no doubt that in the early stages of our career, or in a new situation, we are all prone to doubt our own place and idealise the expertise of others.</p>

<p>I'm encouraging your mentee to look at you as a real person who has no doubt made mistakes in their career. Technological errors. Bugs in production. Upsetting folks you work with. All of the above!</p>

<p>Sorry that they will no longer revere you as a programming god. :-)</p>

<p>That said if they do bring it up, feel free to tell a tale of your errors and reassure them that you'll keep making mistakes as you learn and so will they. The trick is not to keep repeating those mistakes. <i>Right?</i></p>

<h2>Let me know how it's going!</h2>

<p>I'd love to hear about the discussions you're having. Let me know about any of the following and I can tailor these emails to help the next batch of mentees through the programme:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Specific challenges your mentee faces.</li>
  <li>Areas of Ruby, Rails and programming in general that they find puzzling.</li>
  <li>Resources you are recommending to them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just hit reply! Speak soon.</p>
